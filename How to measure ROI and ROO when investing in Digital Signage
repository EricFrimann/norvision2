Digital signage presents businesses with a powerful tool to effectively communicate with customers and promote their brand. However, making an investment in digital signage necessitates careful consideration and planning to ensure a satisfactory return on investment (ROI) and return on objectives (ROO). In this blog post, we will explore the process of defining ROI and ROO when venturing into digital signage.

ROI in Digital Signage

ROI in digital signage pertains to the financial return a business anticipates from its digital signage investment. To calculate ROI, a company must ascertain the total cost of the investment and the projected revenue generated as a result.
Outlined below are the steps involved in defining ROI when investing in digital signage:
Determine the investment cost: This encompasses the expenses associated with digital signage hardware, software, installation, and ongoing maintenance.
Establish measurable objectives: A business must define measurable objectives to evaluate the anticipated revenue derived from the investment. For instance, if the objective is to increase sales, it is crucial to determine the target amount and the duration within which the sales growth is desired.
Track and measure results: After the digital signage is installed, it is essential to monitor and measure the outcomes. Analytics tools can be employed to track metrics such as the number of views, duration of views, and user engagement.
Calculate ROI: Once the results are tracked, the ROI can be calculated by subtracting the investment cost from the generated revenue and dividing it by the investment cost. The formula for ROI is as follows: (Revenue â€“ Investment Cost) / Investment Cost x 100.
ROO in Digital Signage
ROO in digital signage refers to the non-financial objectives a business aims to achieve through its investment in digital signage. These objectives may encompass enhancing customer engagement, increasing brand awareness, or improving customer satisfaction.
The steps involved in defining ROO when investing in digital signage are as follows:
Determine objectives: To ascertain the ROO, a business must identify its specific objectives. These objectives might be centered on improving customer engagement, increasing brand awareness, or enhancing customer satisfaction.
Establish measurable objectives: To gauge the success of the investment, it is necessary to set measurable objectives. For instance, if the goal is to enhance customer engagement, metrics such as the number of clicks, likes, or shares can be employed to measure engagement levels.
Track and measure results: Once the digital signage is deployed, it is important to monitor and measure the outcomes. Analytics tools can aid in tracking metrics related to viewership, duration of engagement, and user interactions.
Evaluate the results: After the results are tracked, a business can assess the success of the investment by comparing the actual outcomes with the expected results. The investment can be deemed successful if the actual results meet or exceed the desired outcomes.
Conclusion
Accurately measuring ROI and ROO in digital signage is crucial for comprehending the impact of your investment and optimizing your outcomes. By defining your goals and objectives, tracking relevant metrics, and analyzing the data, you can make well-informed decisions regarding your digital signage strategy and improve both your ROI and ROO.
